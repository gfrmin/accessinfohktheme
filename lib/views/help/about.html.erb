    <dt id="purpose">What is <%= site_name %> for? <a href="#purpose">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>To help you find out inside information about what the Hong Kong government
    is doing.
    </dd>

    <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
    write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
    to the public authority. Any response they make is automatically published on the
    website for you and anyone else to find and read.

    <dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
    things that affect your life, from healthcare through to housing. Some
    it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
    works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
    are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.

      <p>Under the <a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a>, government departments are expected to respond. The Code was introduced in 1995 and applies to all Hong Kong government bureaux, departments, and certain public bodies.</p>

      <p>The response will either contain the information you want, or give a valid reason under <a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/part2.html">Part 2 of the Code</a> why it must be kept confidential.</p>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> The Code is an <strong>administrative code</strong>, not legislation. This means departments are expected to comply, but there is no statutory right to information. If you're dissatisfied with a response, you can request an internal review or complain to <a href="https://www.ombudsman.hk/">The Ombudsman (申訴專員)</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="timelines">How long should I wait for a response? <a href="#timelines">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Under the Code on Access to Information, departments should follow these timelines (measured in <strong>calendar days</strong>):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>10 calendar days:</strong> You should receive either the information or an interim reply explaining why more time is needed</li>
        <li><strong>21 calendar days:</strong> This is the target time for providing the information</li>
        <li><strong>51 calendar days:</strong> Maximum time in exceptional circumstances (departments must explain why an extension is needed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If a department exceeds these timeframes without explanation, you may request an internal review or complain to The Ombudsman.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="costs">Does it cost anything to get information? <a href="#costs">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Making a request is free, but you may need to pay photocopying charges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HK$1.5 per A4 page</strong></li>
        <li><strong>HK$1.6 per A3 page</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Departments will inform you in advance if charges apply. Information will not be released until payment is made.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="reporting">What if I see a request I feel to be inappropriate? <a href="#reporting">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Requests for personal information, vexatious requests and requests which would harm or prejudice Hong Kong's defence and security are not considered valid for FOI purposes (<a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/part2.html">read more</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe a request is not suitable, you can report it for attention by the site administrators.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="reporting_unavailable">Why won't it let me report some requests? <a href="#reporting_unavailable">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
    <p> 
    If a request has already been reported to the site administrators, you
    can't report it a second time - this is to prevent the administrators
    being notified multiple times about the same issue before they've had
    a chance to conduct a review.
    </p>
    <p>
    Where a request has been previously reported but an administrator has
    chosen not to hide it from public view, you can use the form in the
    sidebar of the request page to contact the administrators if you still
    think it should be hidden.
