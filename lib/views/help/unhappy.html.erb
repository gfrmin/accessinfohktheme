<ol>
  <li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> by a senior officer at the department.</li>

    <%= link_to "Request an internal review", new_request_followup_path(@info_request.url_title, internal_review: '1', anchor: 'followup'), :class => 'link_button_green request-internal-review-action' %> and then write a message asking the department to review your request.
  <% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on <%= site_name %> choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>Internal reviews under the Code on Access to Information should be conducted by a directorate officer
  at least one rank senior to the officer who made the original decision. The department should respond
  to your review request promptly. You will then either get the information that
  you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
  original decision with reasons.
</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> When requesting an internal review, clearly state why you believe the
  original decision was incorrect. Reference specific provisions of the
  <a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a> where relevant.</p>

<h1 id="complaining">2. Complaining to The Ombudsman <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the department has completed their internal review,
  you can lodge a complaint with <strong>The Ombudsman</strong> (申訴專員). The Ombudsman
  investigates complaints about non-compliance with the Code on Access to Information by
  Hong Kong government departments and public bodies.</p>

<p>To lodge a complaint with The Ombudsman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://www.ombudsman.hk/">The Ombudsman's website</a> (available in English and Chinese)</li>
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://www.ombudsman.hk/howtocomplain/">complaint form</a></li>
  <li>Provide details of your original request, the department's response, and the internal review outcome</li>
  <li>
    <% if @info_request %>
      Include a link to your request: <strong><%=h request_url(@info_request) %></strong>
    <% else %>
      Include a link to your request on <%= site_name %>
    <% end %>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Ombudsman handles administrative complaints. Unlike jurisdictions with
  Freedom of Information laws, Hong Kong's Code on Access to Information is an administrative code
  (not legislation), so there is no legal appeal to courts or tribunals. The Ombudsman's investigation
  and recommendations are the primary external oversight mechanism.</p>

<p><%= site_name %> has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
  passes into The Ombudsman's system. You can leave annotations on your
  request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a <strong>new access to information request</strong> for summary information, or for
    documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
    <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
  <li>If any <strong>other government departments</strong> or public bodies are involved,
    make requests to them. Sometimes information refused by one department may be
    available from another.</li>
  <li>Contact <strong>your Legislative Council (LegCo) member</strong> and ask for their help
    finding the answer. LegCo members can ask questions to government officials and raise
    issues through parliamentary procedures. You can find your geographical constituency member
    or contact functional constituency members relevant to your topic.</li>
  <li>Check if the information is already available in <strong>government disclosure logs</strong>
    or proactive publications. Some departments maintain disclosure logs of previously released
    information on their websites.</li>
  <li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
    issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site and
    contacting any registered user from their page.</li>
  <li>Consider working with <strong>civil society organizations</strong>, journalists, or
    academics who may have experience obtaining similar information or could collaborate
    on your research.</li>
  <li>You could form a small campaign group to raise public awareness about the issue
    and arrange meetings with departmental staff.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="timelines">Understanding Hong Kong's response timelines <a class="hover_a" href="#timelines">#</a> </h1>

<p>Under the Code on Access to Information, departments should follow these timelines
  (measured in <strong>calendar days</strong>, not working days):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>10 calendar days:</strong> Initial response with information, or an interim reply
    explaining why more time is needed</li>
  <li><strong>21 calendar days:</strong> Target completion time for providing the information</li>
  <li><strong>51 calendar days:</strong> Maximum time in exceptional circumstances (departments
    must explain why an extension is needed, and extensions should be kept to a minimum)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a department takes longer than these timeframes without explanation, you have grounds
  to request an internal review or complain to The Ombudsman.</p>

  timeline requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/part2.html">valid
