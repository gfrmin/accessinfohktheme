  <p>Under the <a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a>, making a request for information is free. However, departments may charge for photocopying costs if your request results in a large amount of documentary information.</p>

  <h2 id="standard_charges">Standard Photocopying Charges <a href="#standard_charges">#</a></h2>

  <p>The prevailing standard photocopying charges are:</p>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Information will not be released until the requisite payment has been made.</p>

  <h2 id="when_charged">When Will I Be Charged? <a href="#when_charged">#</a></h2>

  <p>Charges typically apply when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your request results in a <strong>large volume</strong> of documents</li>
    <li>The department needs to make <strong>physical photocopies</strong> of paper records</li>
    <li>The information cannot be provided electronically</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Charges are <strong>less likely</strong> to apply if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The information can be provided as <strong>electronic documents</strong> (via email)</li>
    <li>The response is only a <strong>few pages</strong></li>
    <li>The information already exists in <strong>electronic format</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="notification">How Will I Know If Charges Apply? <a href="#notification">#</a></h2>

  <p>If photocopying charges will apply, the department should:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inform you in advance</strong> of the estimated charges</li>
    <li><strong>Obtain your agreement</strong> to pay before proceeding</li>
    <li><strong>Provide payment instructions</strong> (bank transfer, cheque, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm receipt of payment</strong> before releasing the information</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The department's notification should appear as a response to your request on <%= site_name %>. You can then decide whether to proceed with payment or refine your request to reduce costs.</p>

  <h2 id="reducing_costs">How to Reduce or Avoid Charges <a href="#reducing_costs">#</a></h2>

  <p>You can minimize photocopying charges by:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Request electronic copies</dt>
    <dd>Explicitly ask for information to be provided as <strong>electronic documents via email</strong> rather than physical photocopies. This is often faster and usually free.</dd>

    <dt>Narrow your request</dt>
    <dd>If the estimated charge is too high, <strong>refine your request</strong> to cover a more specific time period, fewer documents, or summary information.</dd>

    <dt>Request digital-born documents</dt>
    <dd>Ask for information that was created electronically (emails, spreadsheets, reports) which can be sent digitally without photocopying.</dd>

    <dt>Request inspection</dt>
    <dd>You may ask to <strong>inspect documents in person</strong> at the department's office instead of receiving photocopies. You can then photograph or note only what you need.</dd>

    <dt>Request summary information</dt>
    <dd>Instead of requesting all documents, ask for a <strong>summary, table, or extract</strong> of key information, which may be shorter.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="excessive_charges">What If the Charges Seem Excessive? <a href="#excessive_charges">#</a></h2>

  <p>If you believe the photocopying charges quoted by a department are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Higher than the standard HK$1.5/1.6 rates</li>
    <li>Applied to information that could easily be provided electronically</li>
    <li>Unreasonable given the nature of your request</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Query the charges</strong> by sending a followup message through <%= site_name %></li>
    <li><strong>Ask for a breakdown</strong> of how the charges were calculated</li>
    <li><strong>Request alternatives</strong> such as electronic provision or inspection</li>
    <li><strong>Request an internal review</strong> if you believe the charges are being used to deter your request</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="payment_methods">How to Make Payment <a href="#payment_methods">#</a></h2>

  <p>Each department may have different payment procedures. Common methods include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bank transfer</strong> to the department's designated account</li>
    <li><strong>Cheque</strong> payable to "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"</li>
    <li><strong>In-person payment</strong> at the department's office</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic payment</strong> via government payment systems (if available)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The department should provide specific payment instructions in their response to your request. Follow their instructions and keep proof of payment (transaction reference, receipt, etc.).</p>

  <h2 id="after_payment">After Making Payment <a href="#after_payment">#</a></h2>

  <p>Once you've made payment:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Send proof of payment</strong> to the department through <%= site_name %></li>
    <li><strong>Reference your request</strong> and the payment transaction details</li>
    <li><strong>Wait for confirmation</strong> that payment was received</li>
    <li><strong>Expect the information</strong> to be released after payment confirmation</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The department should release the information promptly after confirming receipt of payment. If there are further delays, send a polite reminder.</p>

  <h2 id="no_charge_for">What You Should NOT Be Charged For <a href="#no_charge_for">#</a></h2>

  <p>Under the Code, departments should NOT charge for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Processing your request</strong> - staff time and administrative costs</li>
    <li><strong>Searching for information</strong> - locating and retrieving records</li>
    <li><strong>Reviewing information</strong> - considering exemptions or redacting documents</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic provision</strong> - sending documents via email (in most cases)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a department tries to charge for these activities, you should <strong>query it immediately</strong> and reference the Code's provisions.</p>

  <h2 id="refusing_to_pay">What If I Don't Want to Pay? <a href="#refusing_to_pay">#</a></h2>

  <p>If photocopying charges are quoted and you don't want to pay, you have several options:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Refine your request</strong> to reduce the volume (fewer documents, shorter time period)</li>
    <li><strong>Request electronic copies</strong> instead of physical photocopies</li>
    <li><strong>Request inspection</strong> of documents at the department's office</li>
    <li><strong>Abandon the request</strong> if the cost is prohibitive</li>
    <li><strong>Make a narrower new request</strong> for the most important information</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Remember: The department cannot proceed to release information without your agreement to pay, so you're not obligated to proceed if the charges are too high.</p>
